# Windows Style Builder tool
A tool for Windows Style Builder made to fix certain issues with it. Translated from Chinese to English-US and now it hooks into "Windows Style Builder.exe" instead of "wsbapp.dll" so you have to bring your own copy of Windows Style Builder.

## Note:
- After building the project, you need to manually modify "\Release\MWSettings.exe" to "MWSettings.dll"
- 1.5.6.5 will crash trying to open it for the first time. It will work fine afterwards.
